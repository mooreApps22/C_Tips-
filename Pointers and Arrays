POINTERS AND ARRAYS 

- Any operation that can be done by array subscripting can also be done w/ pointers 

Ex: 
    int a[10];    // declares an array of 10 int values 
    int *pa;      // pa is a pointer to an int value, yet to be determined 
    pa = &a[0];   // pa is now a[0]
    int x = *pa;  // x is now a[0] also 
    
- The name of an array is synonymous with the location of the initial element 
  
Ex: 
    pa = &a[0]; // 
    pa = a;
