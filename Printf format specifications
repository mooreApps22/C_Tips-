PRINTF FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS

     - Ex: printf("%3d", x); 
  
  3. %f - print as floating point (float or double) 
    - Ex: printf("%f", x); 
   
  4. %.2f - print as floating point and only use 2 places after the decimal point (float or double ) 
    - Ex: printf("%.2f", x); 
  
  5. %6f - print as floating point 6 characters wide (float or double ) 
    - Ex: printf("%6f", x);
