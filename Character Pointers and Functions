- A string constant is an array of characters 
  ~ Strings are terminated with the null character '\0'
  ~ The null character means the length of storage is always the number of characters plus one
  ~ The null character is how the program knows where the end of the array 
  ~ String constants use double quotes (") and characters constants use single quotes (') 
    > It is possible to have a string with only one element "?" 

  Ex: 
      "All the small things"      // 20 characters long plus one null character 
      
- The most common function that passes strings is the printf() 
  ~ C does not provide any operators for processing an entire string of characters as a unit 
  ~ C uses pointers to pass around strings
  
  
  Ex: 
      printf("hello, world");     // the 1st element is pointed to 
      char *pc;                   // a char pointer
      pc = "hahaha";              // pc points to 'h' 
      char str[] = "Ho Ho Ho!";   // str is an array 
      char *pstr = "Ho Ho Ho!";   // pstr points to 'H' 
      
- There is a big difference between an array and a pointer 
  ~ An array is just big enough to hold the sequence of chars and null that initializes it
  ~ The chars can be changed but the storage remains the same 
  ~ a pointer points to a string 
  ~ It can be changed to point somewhere else 
  ~ The pointer cannot modified the strings contents 

    Array Ex: 
        void str_cpy(char *cpy, char *og) {   // pass in both array names 
          int i;                              // i is initialized 
          i = 0;                              // i is now 0
          while ((cpy[i] = og[i]) != '\0')    // cpy[i] is og[i] until the null is reached  
            i++;                              // i is incremented 
        }

    Pointer Ex: 
        void str_cpy(char *cpy, char *og) {   // pass in both array names 
            while ((*cpy = *og) != '\0') {    // cpy pointer is og pointer until null is reached
              cpy++;                          // cpy pointer now points to the next element 
              og++;                           // og pointer now pointers to the next element 
            }
        }
        
     -  int *func()        -> function returning pointer to int 
     -  int (*pf)()        -> pointer to function returning int 
     -  **argv             -> pointer to pointer to char 
     -  int (*pa)[13]      -> pointer to array[13] of int 
     -  int *arr[13]       -> array[13] of pointer to int 
     -  void *func()       -> function returning pointer to void 
     -  void (*comp)()     -> pointer to function returning void 
     -  char (*(*x())[])() -> function returning pointer to array[] of pointer to function returning char
     -  char (*(*x[3])())[5] -> array[3] of pointer to function returning pointer to array[5] of char
