- Main is called with two arguments
  ~ The first argument is an int conventionally called argc (for argument count)
  ~ The second argument is a char pointer called argv (for argument vector)
- argc is the number of command line arguments excuted with the program 
- argv is a pointer to an array of character strings that contain the arguments 
   ~ One per string 
- argv[0] is the name of the program 
   ~ So, argv[1] would pointer to the first string you pass into the command line 
   ~ The first optional argument is argv[1]
   ~ The last optional argument is argv[argc-1]
   ~ argv[argc] is a null pointer 
- argc 1 refers to argv[0]
    ~ So argc would be 2 if you only passed one string when you execute the program 

  Ex: 
    #include <stdio.h>                 
    main(int argc, char *argv[]) {      
      int i; 
      i = 1; 
      while (i < argc) {
        printf("%s%s", argv[i], (i < argc-1) ? " " : ""); 
        i++; 
      }
      printf("\n"); 
      return 0; 
    }
